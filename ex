               <h5>Industry Specific Training</h5>

                  Industry Specific Training refers to training programs that are designed to provide individuals with specific skills and knowledge required for a particular industry or sector.

               <h5>Internship Opportunities</h5>
               <p>
                  Gets its internship listings from several sources, including company websites, partnerships with job boards and directly from employers. But its main attraction is that it offers an instant way to search for salaries, company reviews and descriptions of job interviews. Its interface is straightforward, though for smaller companies, the salary and review functions don’t always bear fruit. In the search fields I tried putting in “paid marketing internship” and in the location box, New York City, and I got 21 listings. When I clicked on the first listing that came up, for Inspired Marketing Associates in the Bronx, I found just two company reviews and no salary listings. But a paid internship for Major League Baseball had 37 reviews and one internship salary ($1,660/month).
